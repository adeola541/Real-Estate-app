Developing a real estate app with React, there are several tools, UI libraries, and guidelines  use to enhance the development process and create a user-friendly interface. 

1. Create React App: Start your project with Create React App (CRA). It sets up a modern React project with build configurations and a development server.

2. React Router: Use React Router to handle navigation and routing within your real estate app. It allows you to define different routes for different components/pages.

3. Styled Components: Styled Components is a CSS-in-JS library that enables you to write CSS code directly within your JavaScript components. It provides a convenient way to create and style React components.

4. React-Bootstrap: If you prefer using Bootstrap for your UI, React-Bootstrap is a React implementation of the Bootstrap framework. It provides ready-to-use Bootstrap components as React components.

5. React Final Form: For handling complex forms in your real estate app, you can use React Final Form. It offers a simple API for managing form state and validation, making it easier to handle user input.

6. Prettier: Use  Prettier for code linting and formatting. They help maintain consistent code style and catch common errors during development.

7. React Developer Tools: The React Developer Tools browser extension allows you to inspect the React component hierarchy, examine component props and state, and debug your React app.

8. Responsive Design: Ensure that the app is responsive and works well on different screen sizes. Use CSS media queries and responsive design principles to adapt your UI to various devices.
